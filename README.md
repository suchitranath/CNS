## EX. NO: 1 : IMPLEMENTATION OF CAESAR CIPHER
 

## AIM:

To implement the simple substitution technique named Caesar cipher using C language.

## DESCRIPTION:

To encrypt a message with a Caesar cipher, each letter in the message is changed using a simple rule: shift by three. Each letter is replaced by the letter three letters ahead in the alphabet. A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. For the last letters, we can think of the
alphabet as a circle and "wrap around". W becomes Z, X becomes A, Y bec mes B, and Z
becomes C. To change a message back, each letter is replaced by the one three before it.

## EXAMPLE:

## ALGORITHM:

### STEP-1: Read the plain text from the user.
### STEP-2: Read the key value from the user.
### STEP-3: If the key is positive then encrypt the text by adding the key with each character in the plain text.
### STEP-4: Else subtract the key from the plain text.
### STEP-5: Display the cipher text obtained above.


PROGRAM :-
```
 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <string.h>
 int main()
 {
    int key;
    char s[1000];
    printf("Enter a plaintext to encrypt:\n");
    fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin);
    printf("Enter key:\n");
    scanf("%d", &key);
    int n = strlen(s);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
    {
        char c = s[i];
        if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') 
        {
            s[i] = 'a' + (c - 'a' + key) % 26;
        }
        else if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
        {
            s[i] = 'A' + (c - 'A' + key) % 26;
        }
    }
    printf("Encrypted message: %s\n", s);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        char c = s[i];
        if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') 
        {
            s[i] = 'a' + (c - 'a' - key + 26) % 26; 
        }
        else if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z')
        {
            s[i] = 'A' + (c - 'A' - key + 26) % 26; 
        }
    }
    printf("Decrypted message: %s\n", s);
    return 0;
 }
```
